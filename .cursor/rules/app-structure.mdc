# App Folder Structure Patterns

## 1. Main app structure (Next.js 16 App Router)
```
src/
  app/
    (auth)/       # Authentication: login, sign-up, reset-password
    (landing)/    # Marketing/landing pages
    app/          # Main SPA: /home, /movies/[id], /profile, /search
  components/
    app/          # Feature-level co-located components
    common/       # Truly shared UI components
    landing/      # Landing-specific UI
  hooks/          # Zustand, react-query, general hooks
  libs/           # Axios, theme utils, ErrorHelper, etc.
  providers/      # Context providers (Theme, Emotion, Auth, Query)
  services/       # Per-domain API services
  types/          # Domain models, enums, TypeScript types
  i18n/locales/   # Translation JSON files
  fonts/          # Custom fonts
```

## 2. Best Practices
- Use route groups for organization (e.g., `(auth)`, `(landing)`).
- Put page-level layout logic in `layout.tsx` next to route page.
- Use client/server component split for data/side-effects.
- Keep hooks and types always in their respective folders.
- Co-locate feature-specific components under `components/app/` or similar.
